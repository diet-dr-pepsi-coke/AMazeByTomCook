 * This interface implements the Robot class and is an auto-generated

 * Responsibilities: The ReliableRobot is responsible for creating the sensors
 * used in the robot driver to detect obstacles (wallboards). It creates sensors
 * in any of four directions pertaining to the orientation of the robot. 
 * It also works closely with the Controller to move the robot with the driver
 * using key inputs. This class is also responsible for having sensors that
 * detect if the robot is in a room or if the robot is at the exit. The class
 * has functions that move and turn the robot, which call upon the controller. 
 * It is also responsible for the energy costs of movement and keeping track
 * of the robot's number of cells traversed. 
 * 
 * Collaborators: Controller, RobotDriver, Wizard, DistanceSensor

	 * can measure distances to obstacles or walls in that particular direction.
	 * For example, if one mounts a sensor in the forward direction, the robot can tell
	 * with the distance to a wall for its current forward direction, more technically,
	 * a method call distanceToObstacle(FORWARD) will return a corresponding distance.
	 * So a robot with a left and forward sensor will internally have 2 DistanceSensor
	 * objects at its disposal to calculate distances, one for the forward, one for the
	 * left direction.
	 * A robot can have at most four sensors in total, and at most one for any direction.
